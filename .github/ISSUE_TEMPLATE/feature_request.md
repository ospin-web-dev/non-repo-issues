All information you provide is helpful to us! Thank you for taking the time.

### Describe the feature / change request
e.g. feature request:
As a user on the processes page with a running process in view (see image 1 below),
I'd like to be able to save/pin specific processes to the top of the view.
That way, I can easily clone my high value processes. 

e.g. change request:
Currently, when I hover over the 'clone process' button on a process tile
the cursor does not change into a pointer finger
would you be able to make the the cursor turn in to a pointer finger, please?

Feel free to draw on the screenshots with arrows/boxes or other annotations if you think it will be helpful in being specific.
You can also take videos of your screen and upload them
