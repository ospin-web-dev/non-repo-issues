All information you provide is helpful to us! Thank you for taking the time.

### Describe the feature / change request
e.g. feature request:
As a user on the processes page with a running process in view (see image 1 below),
I'd like to be able to save/pin specific processes to the top of the view.
That way, I can easily clone my high value processes. 

e.g. change request:
Currently, when I hover over the 'clone process' button on a process tile
the cursor does not change into a pointer finger
would you be able to make the the cursor turn in to a pointer finger, please?

**Screenshots**
(upload/click and drag images here! Github makes it really easy - just drag an image file right into the text area here.)
Screenshots are super helpful! You may have other language to describe certain
things in the web app, and screenshots will make sure we are crystal clear on what you mean. 
Feel free to draw on the screenshots with arrows/boxes or other annotations if you think it will be helpful in being specific.
You can also take videos of your screen and upload them

### Deliverables
As a user...
 - [ ] I can click a button on the process widget which fixes the process widget in front of all other process widgets, but after the 'build process' widget
 - [ ] If multiple process widgets are pinned, they are in createdAt: -1 order
 - [ ] The process widgets have a visual indicator on them to show they are pinned
